In this personal project, I attempt to make a visualization of the different choices one makes during life, and how they 
lead to different outcomes. Randomness plays a huge part, since at each point, how many choices are available is 
random (1, 2 or 3), and their corresponding direction is also random (except for the 3 branch option). 
Finally, the frequency at which choices appear varies with the amount of points, with the probability of there being 0 
branches increasing over time, to naturally end the process. 
All the algorithm parameters, as well as the plotting capabilities can be changed in a toml file.


I worked on this project individually, purely for fun and coding practice, to implement and create the idea that I had had.
